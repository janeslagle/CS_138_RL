Requirements:
python: 3.11.5
numpy: 2.1.1
matplotlib: 3.9.2

To run:
Uncomment the plotting function that you want to see the results from in the if __name__ == "__main__": block. plot_eps_greedy() gives you the results for Figure 1 in the report while plot_UCB() gives you the results for Figure 2 in the report.
After doing so, run main.py to see the plotting results.
