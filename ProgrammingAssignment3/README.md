# CS 138 Programming Assignment 3 - Jane Slagle

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11.5
- **NumPy**: 2.1.1
- **Jupyter core package requirements**:
  - **IPython**: 8.0.1
  - **ipykernel**: 6.7.0
  - **notebook**: 6.4.8

## To Run
1. Open 'FrozenLake.ipynb' in jupyter notebook.
2. Run all cell blocks in 'FrozenLake.ipynb' to execute the code.
3. After executing all code, find the cell labelled with "Results from running the first algorithm (7.13 + 7.2)" to get the results from running the algorithm with those two equations.
4. After executing all code, find the cell labelled with "Results from running the second algorithm (7.9 + 7.1)" to get the results from running the algorithm with those two equations.
5. After executing all code, find the cell labelled with "Results from running SARSA" to get the results from running the SARSA algorithm.
